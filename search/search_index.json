If you want to get started using sbi on your own problem, jump to installation and then check out the tutorial . Motivation and approach \u00b6 Many areas of science and engineering make extensive use of complex, stochastic, numerical simulations to describe the structure and dynamics of the processes being investigated. A key challenge in simulation-based science is constraining these simulation models\u2019 parameters, which are intepretable quantities, with observational data. Bayesian inference provides a general and powerful framework to invert the simulators, i.e. describe the parameters which are consistent both with empirical data and prior knowledge. In the case of simulators, a key quantity required for statistical inference, the likelihood of observed data given parameters, \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = p(x_o|\\theta)\\) , is typically intractable, rendering conventional statistical approaches inapplicable. sbi implements three powerful machine-learning methods that address this problem: Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE), Sequential Neural Likelihood Estimation (SNLE), and Sequential Neural Ratio Estimation (SNRE). Depending on the characteristics of the problem, e.g. the dimensionalities of the parameter space and the observation space, one of the methods will be more suitable. Goal: Algorithmically identify mechanistic models which are consistent with data. Each of the methods above needs three inputs: A candidate mechanistic model, prior knowledge or constraints on model parameters, and observational data (or summary statistics thereof). The methods then proceed by sampling parameters from the prior followed by simulating synthetic data from these parameters, learning the (probabilistic) association between data (or data features) and underlying parameters, i.e. to learn statistical inference from simulated data. The way in which this association is learned differs between the above methods, but all use deep neural networks. This learned neural network is then applied to empirical data to derive the full space of parameters consistent with the data and the prior, i.e. the posterior distribution. High posterior probability is assigned to parameters which are consistent with both the data and the prior, low probability to inconsistent parameters. While SNPE directly learns the posterior distribution, SNLE and SNRE need an extra MCMC sampling step to construct a posterior. If needed, an initial estimate of the posterior can be used to adaptively generate additional informative simulations.

[1] Automatic Posterior Transformation for Likelihood-free Inference , Greenberg et al., ICML 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07488 . This class implements two loss variants of SNPE-C: the non-atomic and the atomic version. The atomic loss of SNPE-C can be used for any density estimator, i.e. also for normalizing flows. However, it suffers from leakage issues. On the other hand, the non-atomic loss can only be used only if the proposal distribution is a mixture of Gaussians, the density estimator is a mixture of Gaussians, and the prior is either Gaussian or Uniform. It does not suffer from leakage issues. At the beginning of each round, we print whether the non-atomic or the atomic version is used. In this codebase, we will automatically switch to the non-atomic loss if the following criteria are fulfilled: - proposal is a DirectPosterior with density_estimator mdn , as built with utils.sbi.posterior_nn() . - the density estimator is a mdn , as built with utils.sbi.posterior_nn() . - isinstance(prior, MultivariateNormal) (from torch.distributions ) or isinstance(prior, sbi.utils.BoxUniform) Note that custom implementations of any of these densities (or estimators) will not trigger the non-atomic loss, and the algorithm will fall back onto using the atomic loss. Parameters: Name Type Description Default prior Optional[Any] A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them. Any object with .log_prob() and .sample() (for example, a PyTorch distribution) can be used. None density_estimator Union[str, Callable] If it is a string, use a pre-configured network of the provided type (one of nsf, maf, mdn, made). Alternatively, a function that builds a custom neural network can be provided. The function will be called with the first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can thus be used for shape inference and potentially for z-scoring. It needs to return a PyTorch nn.Module implementing the density estimator. The density estimator needs to provide the methods .log_prob and .sample() . 'maf' device str torch device on which to compute, e.g. gpu, cpu. 'cpu' logging_level Union[int, str] Minimum severity of messages to log. One of the strings INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, ERROR and CRITICAL.

[1] _Automatic Posterior Transformation for Likelihood-free Inference_, Greenberg et al., ICML 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07488. This class implements two loss variants of SNPE-C: the non-atomic and the atomic version. The atomic loss of SNPE-C can be used for any density estimator, i.e. also for normalizing flows. However, it suffers from leakage issues. On the other hand, the non-atomic loss can only be used only if the proposal distribution is a mixture of Gaussians, the density estimator is a mixture of Gaussians, and the prior is either Gaussian or Uniform. It does not suffer from leakage issues. At the beginning of each round, we print whether the non-atomic or the atomic version is used. In this codebase, we will automatically switch to the non-atomic loss if the following criteria are fulfilled:<br/> - proposal is a `DirectPosterior` with density_estimator `mdn`, as built with `utils.sbi.posterior_nn()`.<br/> - the density estimator is a `mdn`, as built with `utils.sbi.posterior_nn()`.<br/> - `isinstance(prior, MultivariateNormal)` (from `torch.distributions`) or `isinstance(prior, sbi.utils.BoxUniform)` Note that custom implementations of any of these densities (or estimators) will not trigger the non-atomic loss, and the algorithm will fall back onto using the atomic loss. Args: prior: A probability distribution that expresses prior knowledge about the parameters, e.g. which ranges are meaningful for them. Any object with `.log_prob()`and `.sample()` (for example, a PyTorch distribution) can be used. density_estimator: If it is a string, use a pre-configured network of the provided type (one of nsf, maf, mdn, made). Alternatively, a function that builds a custom neural network can be provided. The function will be called with the first batch of simulations (theta, x), which can thus be used for shape inference and potentially for z-scoring. It needs to return a PyTorch `nn.Module` implementing the density estimator. The density estimator needs to provide the methods `.log_prob` and `.sample()`. device: torch device on which to compute, e.g. gpu, cpu. logging_level: Minimum severity of messages to log. One of the strings INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, ERROR and CRITICAL. summary_writer: A tensorboard `SummaryWriter` to control, among others, log file location (default is `<current working directory>/logs`.) show_progress_bars: Whether to show a progressbar during training. unused_args: Absorbs additional arguments. No entries will be used. If it is not empty, we warn.

SNPE trains a neural network to directly approximate the posterior distribution. However, for bounded priors, the neural network can have leakage: it puts non-zero mass in regions where the prior is zero. The DirectPosterior class wraps the trained network to deal with these cases. Specifically, this class offers the following functionality: - correct the calculation of the log probability such that it compensates for the leakage. - reject samples that lie outside of the prior bounds. - alternatively, if leakage is very high (which can happen for multi-round SNPE), sample from the posterior with MCMC.

Observed data \u00b6 Let us assume we current-clamped a neuron and recorded the following voltage trace: In fact, this voltage trace was not measured experimentally but synthetically generated by simulating a Hodgkin-Huxley model with particular parameters ( \\(\\bar g_{Na}\\) , \\(\\bar g_K\\) ). We will come back to this point later in the tutorial. 2. Simulator \u00b6 We would like to infer the posterior over the two parameters ( \\(\\bar g_{Na}\\) , \\(\\bar g_K\\) ) of a Hodgkin-Huxley model, given the observed electrophysiological recording above. The model has channel kinetics as in Pospischil et al. 2008 , and is defined by the following set of differential equations (parameters of interest highlighted in orange): \\[ \\scriptsize \\begin{align} C_m\\frac{dV}{dt}&=g_1\\left(E_1-V\\right)+ \\color{orange}{\\bar{g}_{Na}}m^3h\\left(E_{Na}-V\\right)+ \\color{orange}{\\bar{g}_{K}}n^4\\left(E_K-V\\right)+ \\bar{g}_Mp\\left(E_K-V\\right)+ I_{inj}+ \\sigma\\eta\\left(t\\right)\\\\ \\frac{dq}{dt}&=\\frac{q_\\infty\\left(V\\right)-q}{\\tau_q\\left(V\\right)},\\;q\\in\\{m,h,n,p\\} \\end{align} \\] Above, \\(V\\) represents the membrane potential, \\(C_m\\) is the membrane capacitance, \\(g_{\\text{l}}\\) is the leak conductance, \\(E_{\\text{l}}\\) is the membrane reversal potential, \\(\\bar{g}_c\\) is the density of channels of type \\(c\\) ( \\(\\text{Na}^+\\) , \\(\\text{K}^+\\) , M), \\(E_c\\) is the reversal potential of \\(c\\) , ( \\(m\\) , \\(h\\) , \\(n\\) , \\(p\\) ) are the respective channel gating kinetic variables, and \\(\\sigma \\eta(t)\\) is the intrinsic neural noise. The right hand side of the voltage dynamics is composed of a leak current, a voltage-dependent \\(\\text{Na}^+\\) current, a delayed-rectifier \\(\\text{K}^+\\) current, a slow voltage-dependent \\(\\text{K}^+\\) current responsible for spike-frequency adaptation, and an injected current \\(I_{\\text{inj}}\\) .

Often, we are not interested in matching the exact trace, but only in matching certain features thereof. In this example of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, the summary features are the number of spikes, the mean resting potential, the standard deviation of the resting potential, and the first four voltage moments: mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. Using the function calculate_summary_statistics() imported below, we obtain these statistics from the output of the Hodgkin Huxley simulator. from HH_helper_functions import calculate_summary_statistics Lastly, we define a function that performs all of the above steps at once. The function simulation_wrapper takes in conductance values, runs the Hodgkin Huxley model and then returns the summary statistics. def simulation_wrapper ( params ): \"\"\" Returns summary statistics from conductance values in `params`. Summarizes the output of the HH simulator and converts it to `torch.Tensor`. \"\"\" obs = run_HH_model ( params ) summstats = torch . as_tensor ( calculate_summary_statistics ( obs )) return summstats sbi takes any function as simulator. Thus, sbi also has the flexibility to use simulators that utilize external packages, e.g., Brian ( http://briansimulator.org/ ), nest ( https://www.nest-simulator.org/ ), or NEURON ( https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/ ). External simulators do not even need to be Python-based as long as they store simulation outputs in a format that can be read from Python. All that is necessary is to wrap your external simulator of choice into a Python callable that takes a parameter set and outputs a set of summary statistics we want to fit the parameters to. 3. Prior over model parameters \u00b6 Now that we have the simulator, we need to define a function with the prior over the model parameters ( \\(\\bar g_{Na}\\) , \\(\\bar g_K\\) ), which in this case is chosen to be a Uniform distribution: prior_min = [ . 5 , 1e-4 ] prior_max = [ 80. , 15. ] prior = utils . torchutils . BoxUniform ( low = torch . as_tensor ( prior_min ), high = torch . as_tensor ( prior_max )) Inference \u00b6 Now that we have all the required components, we can run inference with SNPE to identify parameters whose activity matches this trace. posterior = infer ( simulation_wrapper , prior , method = 'SNPE' , num_simulations = 300 , num_workers = 4 ) HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, description='Running 300 simulations in 300 batches.', max=300.0, styl\u2026 Neural network successfully converged after 233 epochs. Note sbi can parallelize your simulator. If you experience problems with parallelization, try setting num_workers=1 and please give us an error report as a GitHub issue . Coming back to the observed data \u00b6 As mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial, the observed data are generated by the Hodgkin-Huxley model with a set of known parameters ( \\(\\bar g_{Na}\\) , \\(\\bar g_K\\) ). To illustrate how to compute the summary statistics of the observed data, let us regenerate the observed data: # true parameters and respective labels true_params = np . array ([ 50. , 5. ]) labels_params = [ r '$g_ {Na} $' , r '$g_ {K} $' ] observation_trace = run_HH_model ( true_params ) observation_summary_statistics = calculate_summary_statistics ( observation_trace ) As we already shown above, the observed voltage traces look as follows: fig = plt . figure ( figsize = ( 7 , 5 )) gs = mpl . gridspec . GridSpec ( 2 , 1 , height_ratios = [ 4 , 1 ]) ax = plt . subplot ( gs [ 0 ]) plt . plot ( observation_trace [ 'time' ], observation_trace [ 'data' ]) plt . ylabel ( 'voltage (mV)' ) plt . title ( 'observed data' ) plt . setp ( ax , xticks = [], yticks = [ - 80 , - 20 , 40 ]) ax = plt . subplot ( gs [ 1 ]) plt . plot ( observation_trace [ 'time' ], I * A_soma * 1e3 , 'k' , lw = 2 ) plt . xlabel ( 'time (ms)' ) plt . ylabel ( 'input (nA)' ) ax . set_xticks ([ 0 , max ( observation_trace [ 'time' ]) / 2 , max ( observation_trace [ 'time' ])]) ax . set_yticks ([ 0 , 1.1 * np . max ( I * A_soma * 1e3 )]) ax . yaxis . set_major_formatter ( mpl . ticker . FormatStrFormatter ( ' %.2f ' )) Analysis of the posterior given the observed data \u00b6 After running the inference algorithm, let us inspect the inferred posterior distribution over the parameters ( \\(\\bar g_{Na}\\) , \\(\\bar g_K\\) ), given the observed trace. To do so, we first draw samples (i.e. consistent parameter sets) from the posterior: samples = posterior . sample (( 10000 ,), x = observation_summary_statistics ) HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, description='Drawing 10000 posterior samples', max=10000.0, style=Prog\u2026 fig , axes = analysis . pairplot ( samples , limits = [[ . 5 , 80 ], [ 1e-4 , 15. ]], ticks = [[ . 5 , 80 ], [ 1e-4 , 15. ]], figsize = ( 5 , 5 ), points = true_params , points_offdiag = { 'markersize' : 6 }, points_colors = 'r' ); As can be seen, the inferred posterior contains the ground-truth parameters (red) in a high-probability region. Now, let us sample parameters from the posterior distribution, simulate the Hodgkin-Huxley model for this parameter set and compare the simulations with the observed data: # Draw a sample from the posterior and convert to numpy for plotting. posterior_sample = posterior . sample (( 1 ,), x = observation_summary_statistics ) . numpy () HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, description='Drawing 1 posterior samples', max=1.0, style=ProgressStyl\u2026 fig = plt . figure ( figsize = ( 7 , 5 )) # plot observation t = observation_trace [ 'time' ] y_obs = observation_trace [ 'data' ] plt . plot ( t , y_obs , lw = 2 , label = 'observation' ) # simulate and plot samples x = run_HH_model ( posterior_sample ) plt . plot ( t , x [ 'data' ], '--' , lw = 2 , label = 'posterior sample' ) plt . xlabel ( 'time (ms)' ) plt . ylabel ( 'voltage (mV)' ) ax = plt . gca () handles , labels = ax . get_legend_handles_labels () ax . legend ( handles [:: - 1 ], labels [:: - 1 ], bbox_to_anchor = ( 1.3 , 1 ), loc = 'upper right' ) ax . set_xticks ([ 0 , 60 , 120 ]) ax . set_yticks ([ - 80 , - 20 , 40 ]); As can be seen, the sample from the inferred posterior leads to simulations that closely resemble the observed data, confirming that SNPE did a good job at capturing the observed data in this simple case.

For those default density estimators we do not expect a speed up. This is because the underlying neural networks are quite shallow and not tall, e.g., they do not have many parameters or matrix operations that profit a lot from being executed on the GPU. A speed up through training on the GPU will most likely become visible when you are using convolutional modules in your neural networks.

Using the function calculate_summary_statistics() imported below, we obtain these statistics from the output of the Hodgkin Huxley simulator. from HH_helper_functions import calculate_summary_statistics Lastly, we define a function that performs all of the above steps at once. The function simulation_wrapper takes in conductance values, runs the Hodgkin Huxley model and then returns the summary statistics. def simulation_wrapper ( params ): \"\"\" Returns summary statistics from conductance values in `params`. Summarizes the output of the HH simulator and converts it to `torch.Tensor`. \"\"\" obs = run_HH_model ( params ) summstats = torch . as_tensor ( calculate_summary_statistics ( obs )) return summstats sbi takes any function as simulator. Thus, sbi also has the flexibility to use simulators that utilize external packages, e.g., Brian ( http://briansimulator.org/ ), nest ( https://www.nest-simulator.org/ ), or NEURON ( https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/ ). External simulators do not even need to be Python-based as long as they store simulation outputs in a format that can be read from Python. All that is necessary is to wrap your external simulator of choice into a Python callable that takes a parameter set and outputs a set of summary statistics we want to fit the parameters to. 3. Prior over model parameters \u00b6 Now that we have the simulator, we need to define a function with the prior over the model parameters ( \\(\\bar g_{Na}\\) , \\(\\bar g_K\\) ), which in this case is chosen to be a Uniform distribution: prior_min = [ . 5 , 1e-4 ] prior_max = [ 80. , 15. ] prior = utils . torchutils . BoxUniform ( low = torch . as_tensor ( prior_min ), high = torch . as_tensor ( prior_max )) Inference \u00b6 Now that we have all the required components, we can run inference with SNPE to identify parameters whose activity matches this trace. posterior = infer ( simulation_wrapper , prior , method = 'SNPE' , num_simulations = 300 , num_workers = 4 ) HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, description='Running 300 simulations in 300 batches.', max=300.0, styl\u2026 /Users/deismic/anaconda3/envs/sbi/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/storage.py:34: FutureWarning: pickle support for Storage will be removed in 1.5.

Note sbi can parallelize your simulator. If you experience problems with parallelization, try setting num_workers=1 and please give us an error report as a GitHub issue . Coming back to the observed data \u00b6 As mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial, the observed data are generated by the Hodgkin-Huxley model with a set of known parameters ( \\(\\bar g_{Na}\\) , \\(\\bar g_K\\) ). To illustrate how to compute the summary statistics of the observed data, let us regenerate the observed data: # true parameters and respective labels true_params = np . array ([ 50. , 5. ]) labels_params = [ r '$g_ {Na} $' , r '$g_ {K} $' ] observation_trace = run_HH_model ( true_params ) observation_summary_statistics = calculate_summary_statistics ( observation_trace ) As we already shown above, the observed voltage traces look as follows: fig = plt . figure ( figsize = ( 7 , 5 )) gs = mpl . gridspec . GridSpec ( 2 , 1 , height_ratios = [ 4 , 1 ]) ax = plt . subplot ( gs [ 0 ]) plt . plot ( observation_trace [ 'time' ], observation_trace [ 'data' ]) plt . ylabel ( 'voltage (mV)' ) plt . title ( 'observed data' ) plt . setp ( ax , xticks = [], yticks = [ - 80 , - 20 , 40 ]) ax = plt . subplot ( gs [ 1 ]) plt . plot ( observation_trace [ 'time' ], I * A_soma * 1e3 , 'k' , lw = 2 ) plt . xlabel ( 'time (ms)' ) plt . ylabel ( 'input (nA)' ) ax . set_xticks ([ 0 , max ( observation_trace [ 'time' ]) / 2 , max ( observation_trace [ 'time' ])]) ax . set_yticks ([ 0 , 1.1 * np . max ( I * A_soma * 1e3 )]) ax . yaxis . set_major_formatter ( mpl . ticker . FormatStrFormatter ( ' %.2f ' )) Analysis of the posterior given the observed data \u00b6 After running the inference algorithm, let us inspect the inferred posterior distribution over the parameters ( \\(\\bar g_{Na}\\) , \\(\\bar g_K\\) ), given the observed trace. To do so, we first draw samples (i.e. consistent parameter sets) from the posterior: samples = posterior . sample (( 10000 ,), x = observation_summary_statistics ) HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, description='Drawing 10000 posterior samples', max=10000.0, style=Prog\u2026 fig , axes = utils . pairplot ( samples , limits = [[ . 5 , 80 ], [ 1e-4 , 15. ]], ticks = [[ . 5 , 80 ], [ 1e-4 , 15. ]], fig_size = ( 5 , 5 ), points = true_params , points_offdiag = { 'markersize' : 6 }, points_colors = 'r' ); As can be seen, the inferred posterior contains the ground-truth parameters (red) in a high-probability region. Now, let us sample parameters from the posterior distribution, simulate the Hodgkin-Huxley model for this parameter set and compare the simulations with the observed data: # Draw a sample from the posterior and convert to numpy for plotting. posterior_sample = posterior . sample (( 1 ,), x = observation_summary_statistics ) . numpy () HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=0.0, description='Drawing 1 posterior samples', max=1.0, style=ProgressStyl\u2026 fig = plt . figure ( figsize = ( 7 , 5 )) # plot observation t = observation_trace [ 'time' ] y_obs = observation_trace [ 'data' ] plt . plot ( t , y_obs , lw = 2 , label = 'observation' ) # simulate and plot samples x = run_HH_model ( posterior_sample ) plt . plot ( t , x [ 'data' ], '--' , lw = 2 , label = 'posterior sample' ) plt . xlabel ( 'time (ms)' ) plt . ylabel ( 'voltage (mV)' ) ax = plt . gca () handles , labels = ax . get_legend_handles_labels () ax . legend ( handles [:: - 1 ], labels [:: - 1 ], bbox_to_anchor = ( 1.3 , 1 ), loc = 'upper right' ) ax . set_xticks ([ 0 , 60 , 120 ]) ax . set_yticks ([ - 80 , - 20 , 40 ]); As can be seen, the sample from the inferred posterior leads to simulations that closely resemble the observed data, confirming that SNPE did a good job at capturing the observed data in this simple case.

Very often, these statistics take into account previous domain knowledge. For instance, in the case of the Hodgkin-Huxley model from this tutorial , the summary statistics are defined via the function defined in here , which takes a 120 ms recording as input (a 12000-dimensional input vector) and outputs a 7-dimensional feature vector containing different statistical descriptors of the recording (e.g., number of spikes, average value, etc.). However, in some occasions, it might be of interest to actually learn from the data which summary statistics to use. sbi offers functionality to learn summary statistics from (potentially high-dimensional) simulation outputs with a neural network. In sbi , this neural network is referred to as embedding_net . If an embedding_net is specified, the simulation outputs are passed through the embedding_net , whose outputs are then passed to the neural density estimator. The parameters of the embedding_net are updated together with the parameters of the neural density estimator. NB: only SNPE and SNRE methods can use an embedding_net to learn summary statistics from simulation outputs. SNLE does not offer this functionality since the simulation outputs \\(x\\) are the outputs of the neural density estimator in SNLE . In the example that follows, we illustrate a situation where the data points generated by the simulator model are high-dimensional (32 by 32 images) and we use a convolutional neural network as summary statistics extractor.

Usually, these statistics take into account domain knowledge. For instance, in the example of the Hodgkin-Huxley model , the summary statistics are defined by a function which takes a 120 ms recording as input (a 12000-dimensional input vector) and outputs a 7-dimensional feature vector containing different statistical descriptors of the recording (e.g., number of spikes, average value, etc.). However, in other cases, it might be of interest to actually learn from the data which summary statistics to use, e.g., because the raw data is highly complex and domain knowledge is not available or not applicable. sbi offers functionality to learn summary statistics from (potentially high-dimensional) simulation outputs with a neural network. In sbi , this neural network is referred to as embedding_net . If an embedding_net is specified, the simulation outputs are passed through the embedding_net , whose outputs are then passed to the neural density estimator. The parameters of the embedding_net are learned together with the parameters of the neural density estimator. NB: only SNPE and SNRE methods can use an embedding_net to learn summary statistics from simulation outputs. SNLE does not offer this functionality since the simulation outputs \\(x\\) are the outputs of the neural density estimator. In the example that follows, we illustrate a situation where the data points generated by the simulator model are high-dimensional (32 by 32 images) and we use a convolutional neural network as summary statistics extractor.

On each run, it generates 100 two-dimensional points centered around \\((r \\cos(\\theta), r \\sin(\\theta))\\) and perturbed by a Gaussian noise with variance 0.01. Instead of simply outputting the \\((x,y)\\) coordinates of each data point, the model generates a grayscale image of the scattered points with dimensions 32 by 32. This image is further perturbed by an uniform noise with values betweeen 0 and 0.2.

Usually, these statistics take into account domain knowledge. For instance, in the example of the Hodgkin-Huxley model , the summary statistics are defined by a function which takes a 120 ms recording as input (a 12000-dimensional input vector) and outputs a 7-dimensional feature vector containing different statistical descriptors of the recording (e.g., number of spikes, average value, etc.). However, in other cases, it might be of interest to actually learn from the data which summary statistics to use, e.g., because the raw data is highly complex and domain knowledge is not available or not applicable. sbi offers functionality to learn summary statistics from (potentially high-dimensional) simulation outputs with a neural network. In sbi , this neural network is referred to as embedding_net . If an embedding_net is specified, the simulation outputs are passed through the embedding_net , whose outputs are then passed to the neural density estimator. The parameters of the embedding_net are learned together with the parameters of the neural density estimator. NB: only SNPE and SNRE methods can use an embedding_net to learn summary statistics from simulation outputs. SNLE does not offer this functionality since the simulation outputs \\(x\\) are the outputs of the neural density estimator.

For example, in neuroscience models, if a specific parameter set does not produce a spike, features such as the spike shape can not be computed. When using sbi , such simulations that have NaN or inf in their output are discarded during neural network training. This can lead to inefficetive use of simulation budget: we carry out many simulations, but a potentially large fraction of them is discarded. In this tutorial, we show how we can use sbi to learn regions in parameter space that produce valid simulation outputs, and thereby improve the sampling efficiency. The key idea of the method is to use a classifier to distinguish parameters that lead to valid simulations from regions that lead to invalid simulations. After we have obtained the region in parameter space that produes valid simulation outputs, we train the deep neural density estimator used in SNPE . The method was originally proposed in Lueckmann, Goncalves et al. 2017 and later used in Deistler et al. 2021 (in preparation).

The simulator produces NaN whenever the first parameter is below 0.0 .

When using sbi , such simulations that have NaN or inf in their output are discarded during neural network training. This can lead to inefficetive use of simulation budget: we carry out many simulations, but a potentially large fraction of them is discarded. In this tutorial, we show how we can use sbi to learn regions in parameter space that produce valid simulation outputs, and thereby improve the sampling efficiency. The key idea of the method is to use a classifier to distinguish parameters that lead to valid simulations from regions that lead to invalid simulations. After we have obtained the region in parameter space that produes valid simulation outputs, we train the deep neural density estimator used in SNPE .

See also Marder and Taylor, 2006 for further motivation to identify all models that capture experimental data. In this tutorial, we will show how one can use the posterior distribution to identify whether parameters can be variable or have to be finely tuned, and how we can use the posterior to find potential compensation mechanisms between model parameters. To investigate this, we will extract conditional distributions from the posterior inferred with sbi .

Analysing variability and compensation mechanisms in a toy example \u00b6 Below, we use a simple toy example to demonstrate the above described features.

In this tutorial, we just load the posterior from a file: from tutorials.toy_posterior_for_07_cc import ExamplePosterior3D posterior = ExamplePosterior3D () First, we specify the experimental observation \\(x_o\\) at which we want to evaluate and sample the posterior \\(p(\\theta|x_o)\\) : x_o = torch . ones ( 1 , 20 ) # simulator output was 20-dimensional posterior . set_default_x ( x_o ) As always, we can inspect the posterior marginals with the pairplot() function: posterior_samples = posterior . sample (( 1000 ,)) fig , ax = pairplot ( samples = posterior_samples , limits = torch . tensor ([[ - 2. , 2. ]] * 8 ), upper = [ 'kde' ], diag = [ 'kde' ], fig_size = ( 5 , 5 ) ) The 1D and 2D marginals of the posterior fill almost the entire parameter space!

One way to reveal structures in high-dimensional posteriors is to inspect 2D-slices through the posterior. In sbi , this can be done with the conditional_pairplot() function, which computes the conditional distributions within the posterior. We can slice (i.e. condition) the posterior at any location, given by the condition . In the plot below, for all upper diagonal plots, we keep all but two parameters constant at values sampled from the posterior, and inspect what combinations of the remaining two parameters can reproduce experimental data. For the plots on the diagonal (the 1D conditionals), we keep all but one parameter constant. condition = posterior . sample (( 1 ,)) _ = conditional_pairplot ( density = posterior , condition = condition , limits = torch . tensor ([[ - 2. , 2. ]] * 8 ), fig_size = ( 5 , 5 ) ) This plot looks completely different from the marginals obtained with pairplot() . As it can be seen on the diagonal plots, if all parameters but one are kept constant, the remaining parameter has to be tuned to a narrow region in parameter space. In addition, the upper diagonal plots show strong correlations: deviations in one parameter can be compensated through changes in another parameter. We can summarize these correlations in a conditional correlation matrix, which computes the Pearson correlation coefficient of each of these pairwise plots. This matrix (below) shows strong correlations between many parameters, which can be interpreted as potential compensation mechansims: cond_coeff_mat = conditional_corrcoeff ( density = posterior , condition = condition , limits = torch . tensor ([[ - 2. , 2. ]] * 8 ), ) fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 1 , figsize = ( 4 , 4 )) im = plt . imshow ( cond_coeff_mat , clim = [ - 1 , 1 ], cmap = 'PiYG' ) _ = fig . colorbar ( im ) So far, we have investigated the conditional distribution only at a specific condition sampled from the posterior. In many applications, it makes sense to repeat the above analyses with a different condition (another sample from the posterior), which can be interpreted as slicing the posterior at a different location. Note that conditional_corrcoeff() can directly compute the matrix for several conditions and then outputs the average over them. This can be done by passing a batch of \\(N\\) conditions as the condition argument.","title":"Analysing variability and compensation mechansims with conditional distributions"},{"location":"tutorial/conditional_correlations_example_gif/#analysing-variability-and-compensation-mechansims-with-conditional-distributions","text":"A central advantage of sbi over parameter search methods such as genetic algorithms is that the it captures all models that can reproduce experimental data.
